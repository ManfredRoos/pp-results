	<h2>How do We Preidict Transmembrane Helices</h2>
	<div>
Transmembrane helices in integral membrane proteins are predicted by a system of neural networks. The shortcoming of the network system is that often too long helices are predicted. These are cut by an empirical filter. The final prediction (Rost et al., Protein Science, 1995, 4, 521-533; evaluation of accuracy) has an expected per-residue accuracy of about 95%. The number of false positives, i.e., transmembrane helices predicted in globular proteins, is about 2%. The neural network prediction of transmembrane helices (PHDhtm) is refined by a dynamic programming-like algorithm. This method resulted in correct predictions of all transmembrane helices for 89% of the 131 proteins used in a cross-validation test; more than 98% of the transmembrane helices were correctly predicted. The output of this method is used to predict topology, i.e., the orientation of the N-term with respect to the membrane. The expected accuracy of the topology prediction is > 86%. Prediction accuracy is higher than average for eukaryotic proteins and lower than average for prokaryotes. PHDtopology is more accurate than all other methods tested on identical data sets.
