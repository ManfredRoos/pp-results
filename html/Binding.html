	<h2>How do we predict Binding Sites</h2>
	<div>
profisis (ISIS) is a machine learning-based method that identifies interacting residues from sequence alone. Although the method is developed using transient protein–protein interfaces from complexes of experimentally known 3D structures, it never explicitly uses 3D infor- mation. Instead, we combine predicted structural features with evolutionary information. The strongest predictions of the method reached over 90% accuracy in a cross-validation experiment. Our results suggest that despite the significant diversity in the nature of protein–protein interactions, they all share common basic principles and that these principles are identifiable from sequence alone.
